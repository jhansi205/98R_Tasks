    <h2>All about lord ram</h2>
    
    <p>
      Rama was born to King Dasharatha and Queen Kaushalya in Ayodhya. His birth
      is celebrated as Rama Navami. Rama grew up with his three half-brothers:
      Bharata, Lakshmana, and Shatrughna. He was known for his exemplary
      character, strength, and intelligence. Marriage to Sita: Rama's marriage
      to Sita, the daughter of King Janaka, is a significant event in his life.
      Rama won Sita's hand by stringing the divine bow of Lord Shiva, which no
      one else could lift. The couple's union is celebrated as a symbol of
      marital devotion and love.
